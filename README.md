# Fake News Detection

## Introduction
This Python project aims to detect fake news using a dataset called news.csv. The dataset has a shape of 7796Ã—4, with the first column identifying the news, the second and third containing the title and text, and the fourth column denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the following libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas sklearn
```

## Usage
1. Initialize a TfidfVectorizer with English stop words and a maximum document frequency of 0.7.
2. Fit and transform the vectorizer on the train set and transform the vectorizer on the test set.
3. Initialize a PassiveAggressiveClassifier.
4. Fit the classifier on tfidf_train and y_train.
5. Predict on the test set using the TfidfVectorizer.
6. Calculate the accuracy using accuracy_score() from sklearn.metrics.

## Model Performance
With the implemented model, we achieved an accuracy of 92.82%.

## Conclusion
In this project, we learned to detect fake news using Python. We utilized a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and trained our model. The final accuracy obtained was 92.82%.
